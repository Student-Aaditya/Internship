      <blockquote>
        <p class="quote">❝ I think one of the most important things about the entire preparation process is first of all good guidance, and second of all great mocks. And who better to guide you than students who've been through the same ordeal and that too not too long ago. The guidance I received from NLTI Mentors was just amazing. It was their insight that gave my preparation the direction it needed. Furthermore, it is very hard to come across good mocks that are based on a correct flow of logic and NLTI provided me with exactly those. ❞</p>
